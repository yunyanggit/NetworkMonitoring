**Azure / NetworkMonitoring** is a repository for open source Azure network monitoring tools. Each tool or collection of tools lives in a folder under the main NetworkMonitoring repo.

The current tools/tool-sets are:
#### AzureCT

It will do more in the future, but currently only provides availability information.

#### LogConverter
[LogConverter][LogConverter] contains code for downloading operational network logs and converting them to .CSV files. Files can to be then uploaded to Power BI for analysis.
